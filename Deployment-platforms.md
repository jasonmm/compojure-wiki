# CloudBees
[CloudBees](http://developer.cloudbees.com/bin/view/Main/) is a Java-based PaaS. Developers can run a full develop-to-deploy cycle on CloudBees using CloudBees DEV@cloud (which is Jenkins/CI-as-a-Service + forge) and/or CloudBees RUN@cloud which is a deployment PaaS.

## Getting Started with Compojure
The easiest way to get started is to use the CloudBees Clojure ClickStart which sets up source, Jenkins build and continuous deployment to the the PaaS (shown in the "Example Project on CloudBees" section on the wiki).

## Existing Compojure projects
Use the CloudBees lein plugin for existing Compojure projects. More info [here](http://wiki.cloudbees.com/bin/view/RUN/Clojure).
